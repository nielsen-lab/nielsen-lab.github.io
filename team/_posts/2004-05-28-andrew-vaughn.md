Andrew is a PhD student in Computational Biology. He received his BA in Mathematics from Cornell University in 2019. His research interests are in statistical genetics and human evolution. He is particularly interested in the way that human demographic, social, and evolutionary histories have interacted through time and the way in which statistical analyses can help us understand this interaction.
