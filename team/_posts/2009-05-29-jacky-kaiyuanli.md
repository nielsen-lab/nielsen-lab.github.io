I received my B.S. in Mathematical Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2023 and am currently pursuing the Biostatistics MA/PhD program at UC Berkeley. My research interests lie at the intersection of population genetics and evolutionary biology, with a focus on statistical inference and modeling. I am working on two main projects: (1) developing Local MCMC algorithms for modeling morphological evolution on phylogenies, and (2) designing statistical methods for estimating effective population size (Ne) from Ancestral Recombination Graphs (ARGs). More broadly, I am interested in combining advanced statistical methodology with high-performance computing to study evolutionary processes.
