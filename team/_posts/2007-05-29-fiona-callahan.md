I’m a grad student in the Computational Biology program. I am interested in using mathematical models to better understand the effects of environmental change on ecological communities. In the Nielsen lab I’m currently working on developing computational methods to use data from sedimentary ancient DNA to uncover biotic and abiotic associations and interactions in ecology.
