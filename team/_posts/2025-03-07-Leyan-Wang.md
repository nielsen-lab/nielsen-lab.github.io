I am an undergraduate student majoring in Integrative Biology and Data Science. I am interested in studying population genetics, especially computational methods for inferring population history. In the Nielsen Lab, I am benchmarking ancestral recombination graph (ARG) inference methods and testing their robustness under different sources of errors.
