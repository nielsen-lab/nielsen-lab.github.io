My research focuses on understanding the evolution of the complex autopolyploid genome of coast redwood (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>) and the species' potential to adapt to climate change. I am hoping that this knowledge will help to guide important forest management decisions, including how to restore the old-growth redwood forests and conserve the remaining genetic diversity of these ancient trees.
