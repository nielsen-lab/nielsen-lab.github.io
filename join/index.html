<h1>Join</h1>

The Nielsen Lab is located at 4134 Valley Life Sciences Building at UC Berkeley.  
We are currently recruiting new postdocs and students for the lab. 
 If you are passionate about any of the areas of research  
 discussed <a href="/research/">here</a> and  
 interested in joining the lab, then please send an email 
  to <a href="/team/rasmus-nielsen">Rasmus</a>. 
   
  The Nielsen Lab is committed to supporting diversity in our field. 
   We encourage BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ scholars to apply and we will work  
   to support you in the lab. 

<h4>Visitors</h4>  We often host self-funded visitors  
   interested in joining us for collaborative research for a shorter or  
   longer period. For UC Berkeley rules for visiting researchers, 
    please see 
     <a href="https://vspa.berkeley.edu">here</a>. 
     
     
     <h4>Postdoctoral fellows</h4>  We are seeking new postdocs in all areas of research, 
     but we are particularly interested in researchers with a strong background 
      in computation and statistics and interested in methods development.  


      <h4>Graduate Students</h4>   
      Graduate students in the lab join from three different programs  
      at UC Berkeley:
      <ol type = "1">
        <li><a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Computational 
     Biology</a>. 
    This program is suitable if you have a mixed background in biology and 
    computation/statistics and you think a  
    program with rotations between different labs in the first year is preferable.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ib.berkeley.edu/grad/admissions/index.php">Integrative 
     Biology</a>. This  
    program is suitable if you have a strong background in biology and 
     you are not interested in lab rotations.</li>
     <li><a href="https://statistics.berkeley.edu/academics/phd/admissions">Statistics</a>.  
      This program is suitable if your undergraduate degree is in statistics or math with an  
      emphasis on probability and statistics, and if you want to pursue rigorous training 
       in statistics during your graduate studies.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Undergraduate Students</h4> 
  We welcome undergraduate students 
   interested in pursuing mentored research. Most of the work in our lab is at the  
   intersection of computer science, statistics, and biology. We are looking for 
    students who are interested in our research topics and enthusiastic about doing 
    research. Specific requirements will vary depending on what projects are currently  
    available, but most of our work is computational. We have found that students who  
    have no prior programming experience don't get very much from the experience,  
    so if you are interested in participating in a computational project, you will  
    need to be able to program well in at least one language such as Python. You  
    can prepare by taking an introductory computer science or data science course  
    such as CS 61A or Data Science 200. If you are coming from a statistics  
    or computer science background, we recommend taking at least one course in 
    evolutionary biology. Detailed expectations for undergraduate mentees and  
    their mentors are available 
     <a href="/pdfs/Undergrad_mentorship_expectations.pdf">here</a>. If 
      you are interested in getting involved in our research, 
       check <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/urap/">URAP</a> for 
        availability or email <a href="/team/rasmus-nielsen">Rasmus  
          Nielsen</a> with your research CV and a short statement about your 
           interest and goals for the lab.
